# Howdy! - The Quantum Ad-List
*This is the greatest Ad-list of all time*

## About The Quantum Ad-List
#### Maintainers
This project's maintainers are The_Quantum_Alpha and Pinkisjustnumbers.
Founded by The_Quantum_Alpha

#### What the heck is that?
Made an AI to track and analyse every websites, a bit like a web crawler, to find and identify ads.
It is a list containing over 1300000 domains used by **ads**, **trackers**, **miners**, **malwares**, and much more! 

It is specifically designed for **hosts** file, but can also be used with ad-blockers with the ad-blocker "optimized" variant.

We were testing an AI that could show some basic emotions about internet content, and turns out it was very precise at getting “annoyed” by ads and “unsolicited” third party connections…

From that, I forked our own project and tweaked it in a specific way to basically only focus on ads, trackers, etc. and act like a web crawler, turns out to be very effective!

Since I am more old school, the HOSTS file is still my prefered way to deal with name resolutions, thus allocating only a small amount of time for this project as it is not a priority, I decided to go for one method that could be used for all.

The lists can be used on almost anything, but I only show one way due to reasons mentioned above.

#### Why?
**To block ads!!**

Well, this list has some domains that others don't have!

#### Is it safe?
It is completely safe. 

It does not send any of your datas, indeed it protects them, as trackers and malwares cannot enter your device.
