## About The Quantum Ad-List
### What the heck is that?
Made an AI to track and analyse every websites, a bit like a web crawler, to find and identify ads.
It is a list containing over 1500000 domains used by **ads**, **trackers**, **miners**, **malwares**, and much more! 

It is specifically designed for **hosts** file, but can also be used with ad-blockers with the ad-blocker "optimized" variant.

### Why?
This list has some domains that others don't have!

### Is it safe?
It is completely safe. 

It does not send any of your datas, indeed it protects them, as trackers and malwares cannot enter your device.
